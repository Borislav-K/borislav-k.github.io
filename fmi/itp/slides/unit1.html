            <section>
                In order to create a computer program, a programming language is used in order to give the instructions
                to the computer in a language it can understand.
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>There are several types of programming languages. For now, we will separate them into 2 main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Low-level languages</li>
                    <li>High-level languages</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                A high-level language is closer to the human way of communication, while a low-level language is more
                similar to what the computer can understand
            </section>
            <section>
                Programmers (usually) write in a high-level language. Their
                <span class="important-text">source code</span> is transformed to the lowest level language, called
                <span class="important-text">machine language</span>, so that the computer can carry out the instructions
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>3 more questions arise:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is source code?</li>
                    <li>What is machine language and how does the computer execute it?</li>
                    <li>How does my source code get transformed to machine language?</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <section>
                <p>What does source code look like?</p>
                <pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers><script type="text/template">
                   #include <iostream>

                   using namespace std;
