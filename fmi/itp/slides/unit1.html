                <p>It is a sequence of instructions to the computer, telling it what to do</p>

            <section>
                <p>In order to create a computer program, a
                    <span class="important-text">programming language</span> is used in order to give the instructions
                    to the computer in a language it can understand.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>There are several types of programming languages. For now, we will separate them into 2 main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Low-level languages</li>
                    <li>High-level languages</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>A high-level language is closer to the human way of communication, while a low-level language is more
                    similar to what the computer can understand
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                Programmers (usually) write in a high-level language. Their
                <span class="important-text">source code</span> is transformed to the lowest level language, called
                <span class="important-text">machine language</span>, so that the computer can carry out the instructions
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>3 more questions arise:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is source code?</li>
                    <li>How does my source code get transformed to machine language?</li>
                    <li>What is machine language and how does the computer execute it?</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <section>
                <p>What does source code look like?</p>
                <pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers><script type="text/template">
                   #include <iostream>

                   using namespace std;
                   int main() {
                   	cout << "Hello, C++" << endl;
                   	return 0;
                   }

            </section>
            <section>
                <p>And how does that get transformed into machine language?</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>It has to undergo the processes of <span class="important-text">preprocessing</span>,
                    <span class="important-text">compilation</span> and <span class="important-text">linking</span></p>

        <section>
            <section>
                <p>Compilation is the process of transforming a program written in a high-level programming language
                    (its source code) into <span class="important-text">object code</span></p>
                <p>Object code is the product of compilation. Multiple object files are <span class="important-text">
                    linked</span> by a program called the linker into an .exe file (on windows OS) or a library file, that
                    can be reused by an executable</p>

                <p>Machine code consists of machine language instructions. It is used to directly "speak" to a computer's
